In recent years, Artificial Intelligence has become remarkably good at performing tasks that humans are routinely expert at.
Advancements in Computers learning to recognize objects and faces in images, driving cars, and beating human beings at
sophisticated games has resulted in AI becoming ubiquitous across industries.

State-of-the-art Deep Learning models leverage significant amount of computing power, while training on GPUs for weeks,
consequently consume enormous amounts of energy in form of electricity. As the effects of Climate Change become more apparent,
AI experts are taking steps to mitigate the emissions from training Machine Learning models.

This package enables developers to track emissions, measured as CO₂eq or CO₂-equivalents, across experiments.
``CO₂-equivalents [CO₂eq]`` is a standardized measure used to express the global-warming potential of various greenhouse gases
as a single number, as the amount of CO₂ that would have the equivalent global warming impact. For computing, which emits CO₂
via the electricity it is consuming, carbon intensity is measured in in grams of CO₂-equivalent per kilowatt-hour.
