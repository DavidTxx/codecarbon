Quickstart
==========

The CO2 tracking tool can be used along with any deep learning framework. It supports both ``online`` (with internet access) and
``offline`` (without internet access) modes of operation. The tracker can be used in following ways.


Online Mode
------------

Explicit Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In case of absence of a single entry and stop point to the training code base, users can instantiate a ``CO2Tracker`` object and
pass it as a param to function calls to start and stop the emissions tracking of the compute section.

.. code-block:: python

   tracker = CO2Tracker()
   tracker.start()
   # GPU intensive training code
   emissions = tracker.stop()


Decorator
~~~~~~~~~
In case the training code base is wrapped in a function, users can use the decorator ``@track_co2`` on the function to enable tracking
emissions of the training code.

.. code-block:: python

   # Results are saved to a emissions.csv file
   # in the same directory by default.
   @track_co2
   def training_function():
       # training code goes here
