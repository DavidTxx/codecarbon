Methodology
===========

CO₂-equivalents [CO₂eq] is measured in kg of CO₂ emitted, which can be inferred from two main factors :

.. code-block:: text

    C = Carbon Intensity of the electricity consumed for compute, as kg of CO₂ emitted per kilowatt-hour.

    P = Power Consumed by the underlying infrastructure, as kilowatt-hour.

CO₂eq can then be calculated as ``C * P``


Carbon Intensity
----------------

Carbon Intensity of the electricity consumed is calculated as a weighted average of the emissions from different
energy sources, ``Coal, Petroleum, Natural Gas and Renewable`` that are used to generate electricity from the nearby grid.
