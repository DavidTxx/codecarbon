.. _usage_offline:

Offline Mode
------------
An offline version is available to support restricted environments without internet access. The internal computations remain unchanged, however,
a ``country_iso_code`` parameter is required to fetch Carbon Intensity details of the regional electricity used.

.. code-block:: python

   tracker = OfflineCO2Tracker(country_iso_code="CAN")
   tracker.start()
   # GPU intensive training code
   tracker.stop()


.. code-block:: python

   @track_co2(offline=True, country_iso_code="CAN")
   def training_function():
       # training code goes here


The CO2 emissions will be saved to a ``emissions.csv`` file in the same directory. Please refer to the full API documentation for additional configuration options.
